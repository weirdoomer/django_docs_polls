# django_docs_pools
Pools application from the tutorial in the official Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/)

To deploy Django and Postgresql via Docker Compose on the developer's machine, use a project with a template for deploying the developer environment https://github.com/weirdoomer/docker_django_dev_env. For everything to work properly, read the instructions for setting up and running (including setting up the django project necessary for debugging in the container) in the readme of the template repository.

Since this django project is intended only for educational and demonstration purposes, the repository contains an .env config with the necessary environment variables.
## NEVER LEAVE configs with confidential data in the repository if the project is planned to be launched into production!
